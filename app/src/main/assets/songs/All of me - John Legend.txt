1st verse:
Em            C                     G6
 What would I do without your smart mouth
           D                      Em
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
       C              G6            D             Em
Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
             C                    G6
What's going on in that beautiful mind
            D                Em
I'm on your magical mystery ride
        C               G6                    D         Am
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright


Pre-chorus:
   Am          G6
My heads under water
    D             Am

Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
          C             C
You're my end and my beginning
     D               D
Even when I lose I'm winning

 How many times do I have to tell you
                 D                       Em

             C           G6         D                   Em
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every move
          C                  G6
You're my downfall, you're my muse
             D                       Em
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
            C            G6           D           Am
I cant stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you

My heads under water
    D             Am
