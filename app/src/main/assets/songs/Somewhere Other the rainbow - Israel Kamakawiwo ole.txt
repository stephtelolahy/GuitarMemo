Somewhere over the rainbow
F         C
-  Way up high
F       C
And the dreams that you dream of
G          Am      F
Once in a lullaby...
-    C        Em
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
F             C
-  Blue birds fly
F        C
And the dreams that you dream of

Dreams really do come true...

Someday I'll wish upon a star
G                                  Am   F
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
-     C
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
G
High above the chimney tops
-      Am           F
That's where you'll find me

And the dream that you dare to

Why oh why can't I...
