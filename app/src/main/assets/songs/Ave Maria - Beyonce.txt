(Verse 1):

Am      C               F         G
She was lost in so many different ways

	   F	    C 	       Dm - G
Out in the darkness with no guide

Am	   C	     F	    G
I know the cost of a losing hand

	      F        C
Never for the grace of God

    F - G
Oh, I



(Chorus):

        Am
I found Heaven on Earth

	    Dm	     G
You were my last, my first

	 Am	   F	 G
And then hear this voice inside

Am  G - C
Ave Maria



(Verse 2):

Am	  C
I've been alone

	 F	       G
When I'm surrounded by friends

	      F	      C     Dm - G
How could the silence be so loud

      Am       C	         F	  G
But I still go home knowing that I've got you

	     F		 C	   F - G
There's only us when the lights go down



(Chorus):

           Am
You are my Heaven on Earth

	    Dm	       G
You were my hunger, my thirst

	 Am	   F	 G
And then hear this voice inside

        Am  G - C
singing Ave Maria



(Bridge)

Am 		            G        F
Sometimes love can come and pass you by

           Am 	       G
While your busy making plans

Am     		              G - F
Suddenly hit you and then you realize

	         Am 		 F 	G
It's out of your hands, baby you got to understand



(Chorus):

           Am
you are my Heaven on Earth

	    Dm	     G
You were my last, my first

	 Am	   F	 G
And then hear this voice inside

Am  G - C
Ave Maria

Am  G - C
Ave Maria

Am  G - C
Ave Maria
