Capo on 2.

Intro: Em C G D * 2

Verse 1:

  Em			      C
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
   G		           D
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
  Em                       C
Don't know what you're expecting of me
   G                        D		    C      D
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

(Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone)
       Em		G                C        D
Every step I take is another mistake to you

(Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone)


Chorus:

  Em             C		       G
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
		 D		    Em	
I've become so tired so much more aware
		     C		 G
I've becoming this all I want to do
		 D		     Em
Is be more like me and be less like you

Verse 2:
			       C
Can't you see that you're smothering me
    G		       D	      Em
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
			     C
Cause everything that you thought I would be
       G           D                C        D
Has fallen apart right in front of you

(Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone)
       Em	             G		      C	      D
Every step that I take is another mistake to you

(Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone)
	     Em		              G       D
And every second I waste is more than I can take


  Em             C		       G
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
		 D		    Em	
I've become so tired so much more aware
		     C		 G
I've becoming this all I want to do
		 D		     Em
Is be more like me and be less like you

	D
And I know
       Em  G  Em   D   C
I may end up failing too
	D
But I know
           B (hold)
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you


  Em             C		       G
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
		 D		    Em	
I've become so tired so much more aware
		C		 G
I've becoming this all I want to do
		 D		     Em
Is be more like me and be less like you


                C		       G
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
			  D
(Tired of being what you want me to be)


 Em              C		       G
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
			  D
(Tired of being what you want me to be)
