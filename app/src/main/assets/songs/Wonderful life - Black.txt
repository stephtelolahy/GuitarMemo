Intro:  Am - C

   Am               C
1. Here I go out to see again
                         Am
   the sunshine fills my hair
                           C
   and "dreamsand's in the air"
   Am                         C
2. Gold's in the sky and in my blue eyes
                         Am
   You know it feels so "fan"
                      C
   There's magic everywhere
   Am         Dm
B: Look at me standing
   Am         Dm
   Here on my own again
   Am                  Dm
   "Upstraight" in the sunshine
              Am      C
R: No need to run and hide
          Em         Dm        G
   It's a wonderful, wonderful life
              Am      C
   No need to ??? and cry
          Em         Dm        G
   It's a wonderful, wonderful life
   Am                                  C
3. The sun's in your eyes, the heat is in your head
                     Am
   They seem to hate you
                  C
   Because you're there
   Am                    C
4. I need a friend, oh I need a friend
                  Am
   to make me happy
                         C
   Not stand there on my own
