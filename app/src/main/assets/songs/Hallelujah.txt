          C                 Am
Well I've heard there was a secreat chord,
     C                   Am
That David played and it pleased the Lord,
    F                         G      C       G
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
   C                   F        G
It goes like this, the 4th, the 5th,
    Am                 F
The minor fall and the major lift,
    G               E7          Am
The baffled king composing hallelujah,
     F           Am          F           C   G   C
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu------jah

Am C Am

     C                        Am
Your faith was strong but you needed proof,
    C               Am
You saw her bathing on the roof,
    F                        G    C          G
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya,
    C              F            G
She tied yo to her kitchen chair,
    Am                        F
She broke your throne and she cut your hair,
    G                  E7            Am
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah,
     F           Am          F           C   G   C
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu------jah

     C              Am
Well baby I've been here before,
  C                       Am
I know this room and I've walked this floor,
  F                     G     C         G
I used to live alone before I knew ya.
         C                     F      G
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch,
    Am            F
And love is not a victory march,
       G               E7          Am
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah,
     F           Am          F           C   G   C
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu------jah

Am C Am

      C                   Am
There was a time when you let me know,
       C            Am
What's really going on below,
    F                     G     C       G
But now you never show it to me do ya.
     C               F        G
Well remember when I moved in you,
        Am            F
And the holy dove was moving too,
    G               E7            Am
And every breath we drew was hallelujah,
     F           Am          F           C   G   C
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu------jah

Am C Am

C                Am
Maybe there is a God above,
    C          Am
But all I ever learned from love,
    F                       G       C       G
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew ya.
         C                 F        G
And it's not a cry you can hear and night,
     Am                 F
It's not somebody who's seen the light,
       G               E7          Am
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah,
     F           Am          F           C   G
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-jah

     F           Am          F           C   G   C
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu------jah
