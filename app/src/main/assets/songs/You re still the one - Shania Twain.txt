CAPO III

C
Looks like we made it
F                  G
Look how far we've come my baby
C
We mighta took the long way
F               G
We knew we'd get there someday


Bridge:
C         F      G
They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
          C          F       G
But just look at us holding on
               C            F       G
We're still together still going strong


Chorus:
(You're still the one)
C                       F
You're still the one I run to
Dm                G
The one that I belong to
C                F         G
You're the one I want for life
(You're still the one)
C                         F
You're still the one that I love
Dm                G
The only one I dream of
C                      F         G
You're still the one I kiss good night


Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we could be missin'

(Bridge)(Chorus)(Chorus)

C
I'm so glad we made it
F                   G
Look how far we've come my baby
