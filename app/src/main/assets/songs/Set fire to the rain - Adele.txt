Capo on the fifth

Intro: Am, C, G, F

Verse:
          Am      C
I let it fall, my heart,
           G                    F
And as it fell, you rose to claim it,
        Am            C
It was dark and I was over,
           G                     F
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me,
    Am             C
My hands, they're strong,
          G                F
but my knees were far too weak,
     Am           C
To stand in your arms
          G               F
without falling to your feet,


Refrain:
               F                 Am
But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew,
          F                          Am
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
         F                            G
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win,


Chorus:
           Am
But I set fire to the rain,
            G
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
           F
Well, it burned while I cried,
                                      Dm          G
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name,


Verse:
      Am       C
When lay with you
          G           F
I could stay there, close my eyes,
          Am     C
feel you here forever,
        G                        F
You and me together, nothing is better,


Refrain:
               F                 Am
But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew,
          F                          Am
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
         F                            G
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win,


Chorus:
           Am
But I set fire to the rain,
            G
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
           F
Well, it burned while I cried,
                                      Dm          G
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name,
       Am
I set fire to the rain,
            G
And I threw us into the flames,
         F
Well, I felt something die,
                                      Dm             G
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time,


Bridge:
          Am                C
Sometimes I wake up by the door,
               G                        F
And heard you calling, must be waiting for you,
      Am                     C
Even now when we're already over,
         G                        F
I can't help myself from looking for you,


Chorus:
           Am
But I set fire to the rain,
            G
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
           F
Well, it burned while I cried,
                                      Dm          G
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name,
       Am
I set fire to the rain,
            G
And I threw us into the flames,
         F
Well, I felt something die,
                                      Dm             G
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time,

Outro:
[Chords Chorus]
Oh, no,
Let it burn, oh,
Let it burn,
Let it burn.
